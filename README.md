# About this project

This project was created as part of the application process for a vacancy at Motorpoint Arena Nottingham for a Junior Developer.
The task was to create an interactive events calendar for the Arena with data supplied via an API.
I assumed that the minimum display device size would be mobile and have adjusted the display format to show at a width of 360px.
As part of continued development, I could display the data differently on a tablet/laptop device so the image appears to the left and event details to the right.
As standard, I have not included the node_modules folder but the package.json has all listed dependancies.
